    <p>The last photo booth we tried was called "Photographies". I had hoped to test out the other two booths available, but unfortunately, one was still under construction, and the other broke down just as we arrived, leaving us with limited options. Despite this, I was excited to see how Photographies would compare to the others. This booth had a different setup, offering three poses printed on two identical photo strips for $6.50. Unlike the previous booths I tried, this one didn’t have a warm, vintage tone. Instead, it featured a classic black-and-white filter, which gave the photos a more modern yet timeless feel. While I usually love a monochrome aesthetic, something about this booth didn’t quite capture the charm I was hoping for.

    One detail that bothered me was the branding—each strip had the name Photomatica printed between the photos. While I understand the need for branding, I personally would have preferred a cleaner, more minimal look without text disrupting the composition. It took away from the simplicity and elegance that black-and-white photos often have. Out of all the booths I tried, this one ended up being my least favorite. It wasn’t a bad experience, but it lacked the character and unique touch that made the other booths stand out. For the price and the overall results, I’d give it a 3 out of 5. If you enjoy a straightforward black-and-white aesthetic and don’t mind a bit of branding on your strips, this booth might still be worth a try!</p>
