    <p>Hi, my name is Joanna! I'm from the Bay Area and a student at the University of San Francisco, where I study Entrepreneurship and Design. I've always loved going to photo booths ‚Äî it's a fun hobby I share with my boyfriend. During our first week of dating, we even took a photo booth picture together at one of my Campus Activties Board (CAB) events. We've now been together for over a year, and we met right here at USF. Recently, we finally visited the Photo Booth Museum by Photomatica in San Francisco, which had been on our list for a while. My blog is all about my experience exploring the museum and reviewing the different vintage photo booths inside.</p>

    <p>The Photobooth Museum by Photomatica was a small but charming space, decorated with cool photo displays on the walls. They offer five photo booths, though one was out of order and another was still a work in progress. Each booth had a reasonable price of around $5‚Äì$6, with slight variations in features‚Äîsome differed in the number of poses, the number of photo strips, the time it took for the photos to develop, and overall photo quality. In addition to the photo booths, they sell merchandise like sweaters, digital copies of your photos for $3, and keychains for $10 each. I bought two keychains‚Äîone for myself and one for my boyfriend‚Äîwhich, after tax, came to $21.73. A nice bonus was that purchasing the keychains included digital copies of our photos at no extra charge. We also got to customize our keychains and they showed us how to assemble them properly. Overall, it was a fun and memorable activity to do with my boyfriend. The Photobooth Museum by Photomatica was a unique experience, and I would definitely go again!</p>
