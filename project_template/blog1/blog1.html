    <p>The first photo booth I tried was called "Photos." Since I had never used a vintage photo booth before, I didn’t know what to expect. After we paid, the camera snapped our first picture much faster than I anticipated, which resulted in a goofy, unexpected shot — but that’s part of the fun! Once our session finished, we waited for the photos to develop. When they finally printed, they came out wet, so we had to carefully air-dry them before handling them. Despite the extra step, I appreciated how authentic the process felt — like stepping back in time.

    I loved the black-and-white look of these photos, which gave them a classic, timeless feel. However, the dark background created a strong contrast against our hair, which made some details harder to see. While this booth had its quirks, the unique experience and vintage aesthetic made it memorable. Considering the $5.50 price and the quality for 4 poses in 1 photo strip, I’d say it was well worth it. Out of the three booths I tried, this one ended up being my second favorite. I’d give it a solid 4 out of 5 for its charm, photo quality, and the fun, unexpected moments it captured. </p>
